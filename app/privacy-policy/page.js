          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
          The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) explicitly protects minors under the age of 13. Our Site is not directed to those under 18 years of age. Furthermore, we do not focus on collecting, neither do we intentionally collect Personal Data from children. Nevertheless, if a such a case were to arise where we have silenced our focus and have been provided with such data by a minor, we will make endeavours to expunge such data.

          This policy may be amended at Management’s discretion with or without notice. However, the management may change such policies and post them with an updated effective date. After the changes have been undertaken, the use of links to our site, by the visitor or customer, shows that he/she agrees to the new Privacy Policy in its edited version.
